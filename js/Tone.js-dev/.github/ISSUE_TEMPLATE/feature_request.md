**The feature you'd like**
A description of a module or method which you'd like to be included in Tone.js

**Any alternatives you've considered**
Are there existing modules or methods within Tone.js which can be combined to do the same thing? Are there other libraries or reference implementations which do a similar thing? 

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

**Feature Requests will eventually be closed if inactive**
Consider submitted a Pull Request for the feature you want. If no one addresses your feature, it will eventually be closed due to inactivity. Though, someone could always implement your feature request after it's closed. Closing issues automatically keeps features requests from piling up.
